Task



In this programming assignment, you will implement a front-end interface using React that consumes an API. Please read through the entire MP before you start.

Requirements



Create a single-page React app that lets users interact with the data from one of the following APIs.

TMDB

Pokemon

NASA

Marvel

Jelly Belly Wiki

The Meal DB

Art Institute of Chicago

More APIs if you want to explore here (please keep it class appropriate) 🫵🤨📸.

Note that you may need to create an account and/or acquire an API key for some of the APIs. GitHub won’t restrict you from pushing API keys, but may send an email to say some keys are exposed. Because of this, please don't use any paid APIs.

The API you are working with may become temporarily unavailable. If/when this happens, it doesn't mean you are blocked from working on the MP. You can mock the data, i.e. create a local hard coded response and use that instead of making the request.

You may need to deal with APIs having rate-limiting policies. You can find ways to get around them like caching the results of large and common API calls

These are also good opportunities to think about how your app should handle errors.

Your app should have the following features:

A list view: where users can input a query into a search bar and the app returns a list of results that match the query (i.e. searching movies or pokemon). There should also be a way to sort the search results based on different properties of the results (such as the name or rank) and of specifying an ordering (ascending and descending). Also, the search bar should filter as you type. You can sort and filter in the client side.

A gallery view: that displays some kind of image media from the chosen API (gallery of movie posters). The gallery view should also have some kind filtering attribute where users can select one or many attributes and filter the gallery by them (i.e. genres of films or music).

A detail view: When an item in the search view or the gallery view is clicked, the app should display the different attributes of the selected item. Also, this view should have previous and next buttons (can be implemented with arrows) that lets the user cycle through the list of objects. A detail view should have a specific route when navigated to. Basically, a user should be able to access the detail route through a specific url.

Here's an old example that fulfills these requirements: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmDZuAr7QJE

You will also be required to use following tools:

Use React Router for routing.

Use Axios for API calls.

Use TypeScript.

Tips



Start early! This is first MP that uses React so start ahead.

Visit https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html for examples on how to structure your React files.

You may use a React component library for this MP.

We recommend using Normalize.css.

We recommend using CSS Modules, which Vite supports out of the box via *.module.css.

Rules



This is an individual assignment. No collaboration is permitted.

It is not permitted to copy/paste code that is not your own. You are, however, free to look at different code sources for inspiration and clarity. All sources (code as well as reading material) that you reference to complete this assignment must be declared in the submission.

There should be no use of inline styling.

No inline script tags should be used.

HTML tables cannot be used for layout.

If you think something you’re doing might not be acceptable, please ask on Piazza.

We strongly recommend using Vite to get your MP started. If you ignore this, we will not help with any environment issues.

Getting Started



Use Vite (see below) to generate your MP starter code, then run npm install.

After running npm run dev open a browser and go to http://localhost:5173/ to view your page.

Open up src/App.tsx to start building your first component. Visit https://react.dev/learn for many official, high quality resources to help get you started.

Vite



Vite generates a React starter project that requires no immediate configuration, and is one of the tools React officially recommends now that Create React App is deprecated. Use the react-ts template:

npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts

If Vite does not install dependencies for you, run npm install afterwards. The dev server is npm run dev (not npm start), and a production build goes to dist/ (not build/).

Submission Details



Here's what you will need to submit:

On the class repo, click Use this template > Create a new repository. Name it mp2 and make it public (GitHub Pages requires a public repo on a free account). Then clone it: git clone git@github.com:<your-github-username>/mp2.git

cd mp2, then scaffold a Vite + React + TypeScript project in place:

npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts

The directory already has README.md and .github/, so Vite will ask how to proceed. Choose "Ignore files and continue". (Do NOT choose "Remove existing files" -- that deletes the deploy workflow.)

Note: Vite's template will overwrite README.md. Please pay attention to this and use an appropriate method to restore it if needed.

Install dependencies:

npm install

This also creates package-lock.json. Commit it -- the deploy workflow runs npm ci, which fails without a lockfile.

Set base in vite.config.ts so the deployed site can find its assets:

export default defineConfig({

plugins: [react()],

base: '/<your-github-repo-name>/', // e.g. '/mp2/' -- must match the repo name})

Getting this wrong produces a blank page with 404s on your JS/CSS, not a build error.

In your BrowserRouter or Router component, set the basename to match:

<BrowserRouter basename={import.meta.env.BASE_URL}>

...

</BrowserRouter>

Note: Should use <Link/> component instead of <a> to have the same basename.

Set GitHub Pages Deployment Source to Github ActionsIn your Github repo, go to Settings > Pages > Build and Deployment > Source > Select "GitHub Actions"

Commit and push your local changes to this new repository.

git add . # "." adds all changed files, can also add specific files too

git commit -m "[my-commit-message]" # message should be clear and meaningful

git branch -M main

git push origin main

.github/workflows/deploy.yml file automatically makes a GitHub CI pipeline run to deploy your code. After the pipeline finishes, your site should be live at https://<your-github-username>.github.io/mp2. It should take around 1 minute.

Make a video (3 minutes max) demo-ing your deployed website and upload it to Google Drive. Share it with uiuc.web.programming@gmail.com and put the share link in the submission form.

Show the url to prove you are on your deployed website. Then show all the requirement features you fulfilled in your mp.

If you were unable to deploy your website, you can demo your mp locally for some point deduction (hard capped at 80%)Just make sure you do git status and git log first so we can see your last edits.

Fill out and submit the form here.

Large Language Model (LLM) Usage Policy



We acknowledge the transformative potential of LLMs in generating code; however, we are still in the nascent stages of understanding how to embed LLMs in developer workflows to write code more efficiently while maintaining quality. Therefore, we will not be teaching students directly how to use LLMs to develop web applications.

As part of this class, we do encourage students to experiment with LLM services such as OpenAI's ChatGPT to generate source code for MPs. If LLMs are used to generate code for an MP, students must (1) submit their chatlogs along with their source code, and (2) answer survey questions related to their experience using LLMs in the grading form. Failure to do this will be a violation of the academic integrity policy of this course.

# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Oxc](https://oxc.rs)
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/)

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules:

```js
export default defineConfig([
  globalIgnores(['dist']),
  {
    files: ['**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
    extends: [
      // Other configs...

      // Remove tseslint.configs.recommended and replace with this
      tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked,
      // Alternatively, use this for stricter rules
      tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked,
      // Optionally, add this for stylistic rules
      tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked,

      // Other configs...
    ],
    languageOptions: {
      parserOptions: {
        project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
        tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
      },
      // other options...
    },
  },
])

```

You can also install [eslint-plugin-react-x](https://npmx.dev/package/eslint-plugin-react-x) and [eslint-plugin-react-dom](https://npmx.dev/package/eslint-plugin-react-dom) for React-specific lint rules:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import reactX from 'eslint-plugin-react-x'
import reactDom from 'eslint-plugin-react-dom'

export default defineConfig([
  globalIgnores(['dist']),
  {
    files: ['**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
    extends: [
      // Other configs...
      // Enable lint rules for React
      reactX.configs['recommended-typescript'],
      // Enable lint rules for React DOM
      reactDom.configs.recommended,
    ],
    languageOptions: {
      parserOptions: {
        project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
        tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
      },
      // other options...
    },
  },
])

```
